# Introduction

This script was developed for the analysis of Portuguese. I hope it
helps colleagues in the LC area and popularize the use of R. It is part
of our research project developed with CNPQ. Please drop me a line if
you have any doubts or need any help.

# Purpose of this repository

This git brings the scripts for my article:

-   Lima-Lopes R.E. (forthcoming). Beyond the Binary: Trans Womenâ€™s
    Video Activism on YouTube. Accepted for publication at *Digital
    Scholarship in the Humanities*.

This script is specifically about **Concordancing**.

# Package

For concordancing we will need only one package

``` r
library(quanteda)
```

Creating the corpus

``` r
corpus.caption <- corpus(df_topics, 
                     text_field = "caption", metacorpus = NULL, 
                     compress = FALSE)
```

Please, change the variable `pattern` for the word of your interest and
`window` for the number of words (left and right)

``` r
kwic(corpus.caption, pattern = "amiga", 
                  window =6, valuetype = "fix")
```
