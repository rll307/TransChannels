## About
[Rodrigo Esteves de Lima-Lopes](mailto:rll307@unicamp.br) (State University of Campinas)

This git brings the scripts for my article:

- Lima-Lopes R.E. (forthcoming). Beyond the Binary: Trans Women’s Video Activism on YouTube. Accepted for publication at *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities*. 

Soon as the paper is published, I will post the journals complete reference. 

## Context

Each script brings a different research step:

1. Data scraping
1. Data cleaning and preparation
1. Processing Topic Modeling and plotting
1. Concordancing

PDF and Rmarkdown files will also be provided for each topic, please, feel free to use them. 

This script was developed for the analysis of Portuguese. I hope it helps colleagues in the LC area and popularise the use of R. Please drop us a line if you have any doubts or need any help.

# Before you start

## Inspirarion
The methodology for this paper was inspared in an analysis by Silas Gonzaga at his blog [Paixão por Dados](http://sillasgonzaga.com/post/topic-modeling-nathalia-arcuri/). Most of my code was a pure readaptation of Mr. Gonzaga work, who should receive all the credits.
