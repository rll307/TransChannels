## About
[Rodrigo Esteves de Lima-Lopes](mailto:rll307@unicamp.br) (State University of Campinas)

This git brings the scripts for my article:

- Lima-Lopes R.E. (forthcoming). Beyond the Binary: Trans Womenâ€™s Video Activism on YouTube. Accepted for publication at *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities*. 

Soon as the paper is published, I will post the journals complete reference. 

## Context

Each script brings a different research step:

1. Data scraping and cleaning
2. Processing Topic Modeling and plotting
3. Concordancing

PDF and Rmarkdown files will also be provided for each topic, please, feel free to use them. 

This script was developed for the analysis of Portuguese. I hope it helps colleagues in the LC area and popularise the use of R. Please drop us a line if you have any doubts or need any help.
